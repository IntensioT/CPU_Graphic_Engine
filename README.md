# CPU Graphic Engine

Welcome to the CPU Graphic Renderer repository! This project is an exploration of computer graphics rendering using only the CPU. Made for the discipline of Computer Graphics in the 3rd year of study.

## Features

- Basic 3D geometry rendering using triangles
- Texture mapping and lighting effects
- Transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation
- Perspective and orthographic projection
- Phong lighting system
- Physically based rendering
- etc

## Installation
Configuration of the cmake project will be done later. At the moment it is a project in visual studio.

## Usage

The CPU Graphic Engine provides a simple interface for rendering 3D scenes. You can specify the geometry, textures, lighting, and camera parameters using a configuration file.

Example usage:

```
1. Wavefront model
```

```
2. Wavefront with normals
